submissionScriptCSC261
======================

A script in developement for formatting purposes

Disclaimer: This script has been tested, but only briefly. Please back up your 
work in a different directory before using. In particular, see the last few lines
of this readme.

Usage This is specifically built for Grinnell CSC261 Artifical Intelligence.
I am generally absent-minded, so I tried stream-lining the submission process.

The process is detailed here:

http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~weinman/courses/CSC261/2013F/assignments/index.html


input ex:

$script source.scm driver.scm] source1.c driver1.c]  source2.scm

] denotes a driver

NOTES

Requires package a2ps.

This script has not been made to recognize files with different file extensions, but the same name.

v
testfile.scm == testfile.c

Avoid this, it will DELETE YOUR FILES
