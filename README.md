submissionScriptCSC261
======================

A script in developement for formatting purposes


Usage This is specifically built for Grinnell CSC261 Artifical Intelligence.
I am generally absent-minded, so I tried stream-lining the submission process.

The process is detailed here:

http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~weinman/courses/CSC261/2013F/assignments/index.html


input ex:

$script source.scm driver.scm] source1.c driver1.c]  source2.scm

] denotes a driver

NOTES

This script has not been made to recognize files with different file extensions, but the same name.
|
v
testfile.scm == testfile.c

Avoid this
